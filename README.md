# LEXIKO <!-- omit in toc -->

Lexiko (λεξικο) is the greek word for a dictionary. It is a hobby project that combines a few of my passions, both ancient Greek (history) and finding technical solutions for problems. As This is a hobby project first and foremost any mistakes are my own, either in translation or in interpation of text.

## BACKEND APIS

### Sokrates - Σωκράτης

ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα - I know one thing, that I know nothing

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Raffael_069.jpg" alt="Sokrates" width="200"/>

Sokrates (on the right) is a figure of mythical propertions. He could stare at the sky for days, weather cold in nothing but a simple cloak. Truly one of the greatest philosophers and a big influence on Plato which is why we know so much about him at all. A sokratic dialogue is a game of wits were the back and forth between Sokrates and whoever was unlucky (or lucky) to be part of the dialogue would end in frustration. Sokrates was known to question anyone until he had proven they truly knew nothing. As the API responsible for creating and asking questions he was the obvious choice.

## HELPERS
